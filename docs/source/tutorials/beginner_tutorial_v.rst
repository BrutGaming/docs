First Steps
***********
Once you register and create a game account, it will work on our `User Control Panel`_. It is recommended that you also join our `Discord`_. Here you can find further information about factions, get the latest updates, etc. Loading into the game after registration will lead you through a brief tutorial phase. This tutorial is important so pay attention as it shows the key locations of the server and other tooltips like where government buildings are, job locations, and the DMV.

Character Create
================
When the registration and tutorial process are over, you will be greeted with the character creation screen. Here you will be able to create new characters and select the character(s) you create to spawn into the game. Clicking on a character once will preview the location you last logged out. Clicking on the same character will then spawn you in the game. At this menu you may also log out. 

Creating a new character is simple. Click the button and proceed with the steps. A premade character will allow you to choose from one of the hundreds of NPC skins Grand Theft Auto V provides whereas a custom character will be one you create yourself from scratch, like GTA Online.

Core Functionality
==================

Mouse
-----
You can press "**M**" to bring up your mouse. Your mouse is key to interacting with certain features like your inventory, shops, and various other UI elements like the chevron button in the bottom right of your screen which will allow you to change character, report a bug, or donate directly from the game.  The mouse also may be used to right click on players when held down to interact with them for actions such as frisking or applying handcuffs.

Chatbox 
-------
To type in the chatbox, press "**T**". You can adjust your chat settings by clicking the "**Settings**" button. The chat is used primairly for players to communicate and roleplay. Many players coming from other servers are used to commands being used for things like opening up a banking interface or locking their vehicle. Our goal is to make as many of those things as intuitive as possible through the use of our mouse with graphical user interfaces or keybinds.

* Opening a shopping interface.
* Refueling your vehicle.
* Repairing your vehicle.
* Washing your vehicle.
* Entering a property.
* Buying a property.

Function Keys 
-------------
Important menus can be brought up using your F keys above your numbers. These are binds in place to quickly access these features so there are fewer commands you have to remember and annoyingly type! 

+---------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| Button        | Description                                          |
+====+==========+======================================================+
| F1 | Report Center, Commands & Help, Server Rules, Roleplay Overview |
+----+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| F3 | Faction Menu                                                    |
+----+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| F6 | Language Menu                                                   |
+----+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| F8 | Console                                                         |
+----+-----------------------------------------------------------------+

+----+-----------------------------------------------------------------+

    | **F1**
    | The "**F1**" is generally referred to as the "help center" or variations thereof. This is considered by many to be the heart of the F key menus because it contains the reporting interface to ask questions, request help, or report a player if need be. It also contains general information about the server such as a roleplay overview and a list of commands available in the server for quick referencing.

    | **F3** 
    | When you hit "**F3**" you'll get the faction menu, if you've joined a faction. Here you'll see a faction roster, the message of the day, financial information, and other useful stuff for managing a faction. This in general is not used immediately in the server, however, we highly encourage new players to find a faction to start roleplaying with as soon as possible. Doing a legal job with others and roleplaying is an ideal way to get started in the server!

    | **F6**
    | The "**F6**" menu is our language panel where you'll be able to manage the languages you have learnt. You can see the progress and switch between languages.

    | **F10**
    | Our account settings and diverse buttons can be found by pressing "**F10**". Here you can modify all settings such as chat settings. You can also open our donation menu with it and much more.

    | **F11**
    | The "**F11**" key allows you to open the map to see where you are and to gain information about certain blips.

Useful Custom Keybinds
----------------------
There are a large variety of custom controls on the server, however, below is a list of the primary ones you should know to get started.
You can bind a command to a key using "**/bind**" Or unbind a key using "**/unbind**"

Making Money 
************
You'll want to make money to buy all of the accoutrements life could offer you in wonderful San Andreas. To do this as a new player, we recommend you join a faction and or do some of the scripted jobs we have made available. There currently are...

* Bus Driver 
* Taxi Driver 
* Delivery Driver 

Some of the jobs involving heavy vehicles will require a heavy vehicle license. Be sure to check which license you need for each job by speaking to the job NPC of your choice. The motorbike license is **$300**, car license is **$550** and the boat license is **$950**.

Banking & Spending Money
========================
.. note::
    There are references throughout the script that state "**p/m**" meaning paycheck per month. This reference to your paycheck being monthly does not mean a real life month. A paycheck is hourly.

After you make your money, you'll want to collect it, bank it, or spend it! When you get paid, your money will come in the form of a paycheck every hour. This money is direct deposited into your account so you don't have to worry about carrying around large amounts of cash as you do your job and get paid.

Any ATM you find functions like a bank where you can deposit, withdraw, or wire transfer money to other players. Each player also receives state benefits totaling **$500**. If you make a gross income of over **$1,000** then your state benefits will end until that number is lowered to below that threshold. This regular income in conjunction with a job you have will help you afford your first home or vehicle on credit, meaning you can make an initial down payment on a vehicle then pay it off over the course of multiple paychecks, rather than have to save up enough money to buy that home or vehicle outright in cash.  

You'll want to go to a convenience store at a gas station or 24/7 and check out what items they are offering. The most important thing to acquire is a cellphone. This will allow you to call a taxi to come pick you up and communicate with other characters by calling them or call 911 if you have an emergency!

Next Steps
**********
Your next steps would be to roleplay! Check out the server, interact with the characters and players, get a feel for how things work, and check out our other `guides`_. We highly recommend if you are new to roleplay to check out our basic and advanced roleplay tutorials. They'll help you get a feel for how we roleplay here and better understand some of the core concepts to have the best possible experience.

It is highly recommended that you look for other players to roleplay with, specifically factions. Factions are a great way to interact with other players AND make good money.
