.. note::
    These rules apply across the entirety of BrutGaming.

*******
Conduct
*******
Users of BrutGaming must treat eachother with respect. Insulting, trolling, flaming, spamming, or acting in otherwise disruptive ways is prohibited. Users must listen to what an administrator tells them to do when they are acting in an official capacity.

********
Accounts
********

Multiple Accounts
=================
.. note::
    Permanent bans are automatically issued as a precaution to prevent multi-accounting in cases where we find more than one account per IP address or computer.

Users of BrutGaming are prohibited from creating and or using more than one account on MTA or UCP and may only use the account they originally created themselves. There may only be one account per computer and IP address, however, users with siblings or friends who wish to play together on the same IP address must seek permission by filing a ticket through our `Support Center`_ or a `UAT Contact`_. This permission may only be granted by a member of the UAT. 

Sharing & Selling Accounts
==========================
Users of BrutGaming are prohibited from sharing, selling, giving away, or otherwise granting access of their account to others. Doing so is considered multi-accounting. Each user is ultimately responsible for the actions of others on their account if it has been shared. Users will not be unbanned or granted an appeal if they let someone else on their account and the rules are broken.

Accounts are considered private, personal, and unique to one player.

******************
Server Advertising
******************
Users of BrutGaming may not send links or otherwise discuss competing servers, communities, or groups of BrutGaming in a manner which advertises them or encourages others to join them or leave BrutGaming.

*******************************
Inappropriate & Illegal Content
*******************************
Users of BrutGaming must not post material or links to content which is illegal as per United States, Canadian, and International law. Additionally, nudity, gore, or otherwise similarly inappropriate content without spoilers, warnings, and a valid reason, is prohibited. 

    | **Example:** 
    | Illegal roleplayers discussing a drug cartel in real life and showing a video of a shootout with a "NSFW" spoiler would be acceptable, showing random gore for shock value is not.

***************
Bugs & Exploits
***************
.. note::
    If you attempt to reproduce a bug to submit it to our support system, please ensure you tell an administrator so you are not accidentally banned. Using the excuse of reproducing or testing a bug is not an acceptable unban reason if you failed to tell an administrator!

Users of BrutGaming may not abuse bugs, exploits, or otherwise use any scripts or part of BrutGaming in a capacity it was not intended to be used. Users are obligated to report any bugs or exploits they come across using our `bug tracker`_. If a bug or exploit occurs which grants or has the potential to grant users an unfair advantage, they should report that exploit or bug to an administrator as soon as possible in addition to submitting a ticket on our `bug tracker`_.

    | **Example 1:** 
    | While playing in game you see a bug where some text is flickering. Text flickering does not give an unfair advantage, thus, you do not need to tell an administrator but should still report it on our bug tracker.

    | **Example 2:** 
    | During the process of moving items around in game, you accidentally duplicate a firearm. This clearly gives you an advantage. An administrator should be told and it should be reported on our bug tracker.

    | **Example 3:** 
    | You move items around in game like in Example 2 and it only duplicates an item once. You cannot get it to happen again. While this series of actions does not give you an unfair advantage every time it occurs, it certainly has the potential to give you an unfair advantage and thus, an administrator should be told and it should be reported on our bug tracker.

*******
English
*******
Speaking and writing legible English is a requirement to play on BrutGaming. English is the only language that should be used when communicating in public throughout BrutGaming.

********************
Third Party Programs
********************
Users of BrutGaming may not use third party programs to gain an unfair advantage over other users. This includes hacking, using third party chat software to metagame, hotkey programs to type and perform an action unrealistically fast, etc. Some programs like Teamspeak or Discord may be used for approved scenarios such as police chases or faction-wide pagers under the supervision of administrators.

*****************
Mixing Currencies
*****************
Users of BrutGaming may not mix or trade in character currency or assets with out of character currency or assets, meaning, activities such as trading real life money for money in game or a car in game for GameCoins is prohibited.

**************
Impersonations
**************
BrutGaming users may not impersonate another player or staff member by using a similar or exact account or display name, or otherwise doing something which creates a certain level of confusion in determining the legitimacy of another user or staff member.

*****************
External Websites
*****************
Any domain not under direct control of BrutGaming may not be utilized for in character purposes unless an exception has been approved by the UAT VIA a `UAT Contact`_. This approval is given with the understanding and agreement that the UAT has full access to the external website.

    | **Example:** 
    | Some examples of this would be an external website created to advertise an in character business, a Dropbox to share an in character PDF document or utilization of any cloud service such as Google Documents, Spreadsheets, etc.

**********

**********
Users of BrutGaming may not utilize someone else's personal content without their permission or pass it off as their own creation.
